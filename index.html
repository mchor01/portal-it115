        <p>Hello! I'm Micah</p>

        <p>I'm an aspiring student, progressing in quality assurance at a professional workforce program called Year Up.
        If you're looking for a high-energy, driven, courageous individual, look no further! As a student, I'm passionate about learning and strive to always grow as an individual.
        Creation and innovation has been an all time passion of mine. My goal is to acquire the knowledge and skills of programming in order to become a full fledged software developer. 
        Outgoing, driven, and visionary are core values that drive me to success. I aim to confidently lead a team within a company and to further innovate in the tech industry.
        </p>
        
        <p>I graduated High School in 2019 and currently studying at YearUp. Leadership is very prominent in my life. I was the ASB Vice-President of my school and led various school commitees at that time.
        As of now, I've extended my leadership skills towards managing a Boba Tea Cafe called "Happy Lemon." At Happy Lemon, I specialize in creating high-quality, tea-based drinks. 
        I aspire to take my passion in leadership further into the tech world. As for education, I'm currently enrolled in a professional workforce program; Where I'm learning the professional quality and skills
        of programming to kick-start my career in tech. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What does Micah like to do in life?
        I like to... 
        Explore the world
        Make memories
        Spend time eating good food!
        Play arcade games
        </p>
        
        <p>
        One quote I live by is, "Live life to the fullest." That's why I like exploring the world, making memories, spending time with friends. Its because doing all those things allow
        me to just live life and enjoy what I like doing. This quote encourages me to make every moment count, to be highly driven, to step out of my comfort zone; It allows me to be me, to live without
        mental restrictions. 
        </p>
